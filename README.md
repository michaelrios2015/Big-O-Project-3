# Big-O-Project-3

This was done for **COSC 600 at Towson University**

This assignement was designed to show the dangers of exponential growth in running times

Execute  two java programs with O(n) and O(2n) time complexity respectively and submit the actual execution time and your programs.
The input to the O(n) program: Linear time growth
* 10 - BUILD SUCCESSFUL (total time: 3 seconds) 
* 100 - BUILD SUCCESSFUL (total time: 3 seconds)
* 1000 - BUILD SUCCESSFUL (total time: 6 seconds) 
* 10000 - BUILD SUCCESSFUL (total time: 5 seconds) 
* 100000 - BUILD SUCCESSFUL (total time: 8 seconds)

Running time probably had more to do with how long it took me to enter the number than actual execution
The input to the O(2n) program: Exponential growth

* 1, BUILD SUCCESSFUL (total time: 2 seconds)
* 10, BUILD SUCCESSFUL (total time: 3 seconds)
* 20, BUILD SUCCESSFUL (total time: 58 seconds)
* 25 BUILD SUCCESSFUL (total time: 27 minutes 12 seconds)
* 30 â€“ There may be something wrong with my code or my program may stop running when the computer goes into power saving mode, as the code has been running for many hours and continues, it should have only taken 17 minutes or so. 
* 40, 50 .. until you give up (more than 2 hours)

Type your answers and execute your programs. Submit their executions.
